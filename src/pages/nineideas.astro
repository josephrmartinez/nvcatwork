  desc="Encourages users to generate new ideas every day. The website aims to cultivate a positive daily internet habit characterized by creative thinking and active engagement, rather than mindless scrolling and passive consumption of information. The ‘daily streak’ tracking is designed to serve the user, encouraging them to form positive habits around internet use. Generating nine ideas requires a mindset of non-attachment, openness, curiosity, and exploration, leading to a more diverse and expansive range of ideas. The process also shifts the user’s thinking from the obvious to the abundant, cultivating thinking that is broad and deep."
