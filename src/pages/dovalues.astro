  desc="A simple and user-friendly to-do list web app that encourages users to identify their values and add action items under each value. The app allows users to add and customize values, write descriptions for each value, and then add to-do items under associated values. Ultimately, the app aims to help users shift from a project-based mindset to a values-based mindset by encouraging them to think about how they can align their daily to-dos with their values."
