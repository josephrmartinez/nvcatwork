Web link, GitHub repo, and blog post link for each project:

### self-empathy app

Guides users on a self-empathy process to understand and accept their own emotions, thoughts, and experiences with kindness, compassion, and non-judgment. The app uses Nonviolent Communication (NVC) principles, which focus on expressing oneself in an honest, clear, and compassionate way while also listening to others with empathy and understanding. The app helps users identify and articulate their initial and underlying feelings, as well as their needs, which can lead to better emotional regulation, stress management, and healthier choices.

### Habitual Reactions Journal

An interactive tool designed to help users develop awareness of unproductive habitual reactions in conversation. By logging these patterns, users can begin to respond intentionally and avoid reactive behavior that can damage communication. What is measured is managed. The app provides a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to supporting participants in their development of empathetic listening and NVC skills when compared with just workshops alone.

### do values

A simple and user-friendly to-do list web app that encourages users to identify their values and add action items under each value. The app allows users to add and customize values, write descriptions for each value, and then add to-do items under associated values. Ultimately, the app aims to help users shift from a project-based mindset to a values-based mindset by encouraging them to think about how they can align their daily to-dos with their values.

### nineideas

Encourages users to generate new ideas every day. The website aims to cultivate a positive daily internet habit characterized by creative thinking and active engagement, rather than mindless scrolling and passive consumption of information. The ‘daily streak’ tracking is designed to serve the user, encouraging them to form positive habits around internet use. Generating nine ideas requires a mindset of non-attachment, openness, curiosity, and exploration, leading to a more diverse and expansive range of ideas. The process also shifts the user’s thinking from the obvious to the abundant, cultivating thinking that is broad and deep.
